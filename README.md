# Simulation control charts
This project contains the Python code used to perform simulations that compare four different control charts applied to a case study.
The following charts were compared:

- Q-chart
- R-SSMEWMA
- HC-chart
- P-SSMEWMA

The results from the simulations can be found in the CSV files, OOC_10_N_20 indicates that the results are for a shift at observation 20 and a total run length of 20 observations.
The run_experiments_V1_Full_Simulation files are used to find the POD of the different methods and verify the control limits. 
The Generate_SPC_Data_V1.py file contains the code used to generate data and find groups used in the R-SSMEWMA and P-SSMEWMA. 

The work was part of a master thesis project.
