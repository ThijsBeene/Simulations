This project contains the Python code used to perform simulations that compare four different control charts applied to a case study.
The following charts were compared:

# Simulations
Perform simulations for four SPC control chart methods:
- Q-chart
- R-SSMEWMA
- HC-chart
- P-SSMEWMA

The results from the simulations can be found in the CSV files, OOC_10_N_20 indicates that the results are for a shift at observation 20 and a total run length of 20 observations.
The run_experiments_V1_Full_Simulation files are used to find the POD of the different methods and verify the control limits.
